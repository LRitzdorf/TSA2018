# GHS Technology Student Association
## VEX Robotics Team G

This repository contains [RobotC](http://www.robotc.net) and [VEX Coding Studio](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/products/programming) code for the Glacier High School Technology Student Association's VEX Robotics Team G.

This year's VEX Robotics Competition was [Turning Point](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/vrc-current-game).

Unfortunately, our team was eliminated during the Glacier High scrimmage round, and did not go to state.
